## Get Started

Install package via Nuget. Using the NuGet package manager console within Visual Studio run the following command:

**Try the following Simpleflow script:**

```csharp
using Simpleflow;
// Simpleflow Script
var flowScript = 
@" 
    let text  = ""Hello, World! ðŸŒ„""
    let today = $GetCurrentDateTime ( timezone: ""Eastern Standard Time"" )

    /* comment: check condition  */
    rule when arg.UniversalId == 2 and (arg.New or arg.Verified)  then
         message text
    end rule

    output today
";

// Execute Script
FlowOutput result = SimpleflowEngine.Run(flowScript, 
                                        new {UniversalId = 2, New=true, Verified=false});
// Access result
Console.WriteLine(result.Messages[0]); 
var scriptExecutionTime =  result.Output["today"];

```

**Output**

```
Hello, World! ðŸŒ„

```
