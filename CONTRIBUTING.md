# How to contribute

Filing a bug and a new feature request, and you can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes. We are always happy to see PRs from community members both for bug fixes as well as new features.


## Bugs and feature requests?

Before reporting a new issue, try to find an existing issue if one already exists. If it already exists, upvote (üëç) it. 
Also, consider adding a comment with your unique scenarios and requirements related to that issue. 

If you can't find an existing issue, log a new issue in this repository.


## Contributing Code

Please open an issue to discuss new feature requests before submitting a pull request. This allows the maintainers to discuss whether your feature is a suitable fit for the project before any code is written.Please don't open a pull request without first discussing whether the feature fits with the project roadmap.

You will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/) when submitting your pull request. 

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

### Tests
* Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
